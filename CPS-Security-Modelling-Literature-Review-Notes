They cited the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework, but considered that their attack categories should be more abstract for their case study.                                                                                                    |

Reflecting on this, my take is that even though the attack cycle in CPS could be simplified based on the assumption that the goal is different, it is likely that the attacker has access to the IT network which would have a different attack model. Therefore it is not enough to look at CPS in silo, but as a system-of-systems even if they are not connected.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Second, that fault tree analysis is broader than attack trees, as it covers failures beyond what the attacker’s action may result in.

| Zografopoulos, Ioannis; Ospina, Juan; Liu, Xiaorui; Konstantinou, Charalambos                                                   | Cyber-Physical Energy Systems Security: Threat Modeling, Risk Assessment, Resources, Metrics, and Case Studies                       | Zografopoulos et al. proposed a CPS threat modeling framework comprising (importantly): adversary model formulation and attack characteristics. They noted that while there is extensive research on threat modeling in the pre-attack context, the investigation of adversary behaviour post-compromise is also important. To this end, they incorporate core components of the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework to support CPS adversarial behaviour evaluations.                                                                                                                                                                             |
